# Personal-Portfolio

**THIS IS A PRACTICE PAGE, IT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MY COMPLETE PORTFOLIO**

This page is a practice run I did on freeCodeCamp where I constructed my own portfolio webpage.

This page was intended to test my comprehensive skills in regards to creating a webpage with multiple sections that all serve a unique purpose.

Key Takeaways:

1. Need to work on optimizing CSS coding, there are unnecessary classes and ID's that I'm sure I could have combined and achieved the same results with fewer lines of code.

2. Need to work on establishing a structure earlier into coding, that way I won't be returning and scanning lines of code and making constant edits until I find the structure I should have started with.
